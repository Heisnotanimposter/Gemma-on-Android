## Steps to run:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Edit ```InferenceModel.kt``` file on **Line 44** by replacing ```YOUR_MODE_NAME.bin``` with the actual name of your model.
4. Build the project.
5. Install the Android app on your phone and enjoy using SciGemma.
